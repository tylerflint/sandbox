# there is a possibility we might want to do something like this in the future:

- user:
    - index
    view:
        - password
        - email
    edit:
        - password
        - email
    - delete
    - create    

# to insert these actions into the database, there will be a rake task that will look like: "rake mother:update_actions"
# the db will then look like this:
# id    |   action
# 1     |   user/index
# 2     |   user/view
# 3     |   user/edit
#  and so on
